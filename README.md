# Welcome to Sell Your Sole (SYS)
As an ex-sneakerhead, I wanted to create a simple frontend design for a sneaker app that allows a user to explore and buy sneakers. 
With the design, I wanted to go against the grain from what you usually see. As oppose to having a page for every sneaker (ie. /sneakerA), I opted to create a drawer/modal that would open when clicking on a sneaker. I find that this looks a bit cleaner and would work very well if building for mobile as well. 

## MVP
1. User can add to cart √
2. User can remove from cart √
3. User can sucessfully checkout √

### Reason for App
1. I wanted to keep up with frontend programming to keep me fresh for interviews.
2. Redux has been my main state management system along with useState. I wanted to use the Context API for extra understanding.
3. One of the soft challenges I had was hosting the image urls to an S3 bucket (becuase I had never personally done it).
4. Some files may use Typescript. Seems like the industry is moving in this direction and I'd like to hone my new skills here. 

Nice to Haves / On Going Features
1. User should be able to pick a sneaker in a different colors
2. Creat a login/sign up page
3. Connect postgresql backend to frontend
4. Allow a user to also upload their own sneakers
